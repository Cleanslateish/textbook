Project: Simple Contact Management System

Objective:
Create a basic program to manage a list of contacts, allowing users to add, view, and delete contacts.

Instructions:

    Define Contact Structure:
        Create a structure to hold contact information. Typical fields might include name, phone number, and email address.

    Main Menu:
        Implement a menu that allows users to select options such as "Add Contact," "View Contacts," and "Delete Contact."

    Add Contact:
        Implement functionality to add a new contact to the list. You’ll need to collect user input for contact details.

    View Contacts:
        Implement functionality to display all contacts in the list. Make sure the output is well-formatted.

    Delete Contact:
        Implement functionality to delete a contact from the list based on user input (e.g., by contact name).

    Data Storage:
        Use an array to store the list of contacts. Consider how you might handle adding more contacts than the initial array size.

    Error Handling:
        Add error handling for cases such as attempting to view contacts when none have been added or trying to delete a contact that doesn’t exist.

Tips:

    Focus on ensuring that each menu option works independently.
    Use functions to keep your code organized and readable.
    Test your program thoroughly to handle edge cases.
