This is the first practice project. Task made by ChatGPT.
This is just for documentation sake, for me to review down the line.
Feel free to do whatever you wish with this, or the code.

Simple Project: Basic Calculator

Objective: Create a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features:

    Display a Menu:
        Show options for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exit.

    Take User Input:
        Get the user's choice for the operation.
        Prompt for two numbers to perform the operation on.

    Perform the Operation:
        Based on the user's choice, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
        Handle division by zero.

    Display the Result:
        Show the result of the operation to the user.

    Allow Multiple Calculations:
        After displaying the result, return to the menu for further calculations until the user chooses to exit.

    Exit the Program:
        Provide an option to exit the calculator and terminate the program.

Steps to Create:

    Create a New C File:
        Start a new file for your program.

    Implement the Calculator:
        Use loops and conditionals to manage user interaction and perform operations.

    Compile and Test:
        Compile your program and test it to ensure it works as expected.

Learning Outcomes:

    Understand basic C syntax and structure.
    Use conditional statements and loops.
    Practice input and output operations.
    Handle errors such as division by zero.
